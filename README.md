## Opalstuff
**Opalstuff** is a relatively lightweight Balatro mod containing a collection of items.

Opalstuff currently contains the following stuff: 
- 13 Jokers
- 7 Stickers
- 6 Challenges (Most Challenges require [Challenger Deep](https://github.com/OOkayOak/Challenger-Deep))
- 6 Partners (Requires [Partner API by BaiMao](https://github.com/Icecanno/Partner-API/))

Please note that this mod is still in development (as many Balatro mods are) and thus objects added by this mod are prone to bugs.
